/**
 * The test workspace for the CAL libraries.
 *
 * Modules are specified as: VaultType ModuleName [LocationString [RevisionNumber]].
 * Workspaces specified as:  import VaultType WorkspaceName [LocationString [RevisionNumber]].
 *   where LocationString is a vault-specific identifier
 *
 * Module precedence is textual order.  
 * eg. suppose this declaration contains the line "VaultA ModuleName", and an imported declaration contains the line "VaultB ModuleName"
 *     If "VaultA ModuleName" appears before the import, the VaultA module is used.  If it appears after the import, the VaultB module is used.
 *
 * Java-style comments (slash-slash and slash-star) are treated as such.
 * Use single- and double-quotes to enclose strings with whitespace and comment tokens.
 * The usual escape characters (such as "\n") are recognized and converted within strings.
